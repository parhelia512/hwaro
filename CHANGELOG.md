# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed
- HTML minifier no longer deletes rendered `&nbsp;`: Crystal's `\s` (UCP) matched U+00A0/U+3000, so a non-breaking space between two tags was downgraded to a breakable space or dropped outright
- CSS minifier no longer mangles descendant combinators inside at-rule blocks (`@media screen{.card :hover{…}}` became the compound `.card:hover`), and a comment containing an apostrophe (`/* don't */`) no longer swallows the rules after it
- `slugify()` treats the ideographic space U+3000 and U+00A0 as word separators instead of dropping them — CJK titles no longer weld into one slug segment
- Block shortcodes whose name starts with a Jinja keyword (`callout`, `iframe`, `setup`, `format`, `blockquote`, …) expand again when closed with the named form `{% endcallout %}`; previously the raw shortcode source leaked into the published page. Hyphenated names (`include-code`) work too
- `absolute_url`/`relative_url`/`url_for`/`get_url` leave `mailto:`, `tel:`, `data:` and protocol-relative `//host` URLs alone instead of prefixing base_url onto them
- `resize_image(width="800")` and `truncate_words(length="20")` accept quoted numbers — every shortcode argument is a String, and these used to raise and abort the page render
- `og:image`, `twitter:image` and JSON-LD `image` handle protocol-relative and `data:` values, and absolutize a relative path that merely starts with the letters "http"
- `robots.txt` advertises the sitemap at the path the sitemap generator actually writes (a `filename` with a directory component pointed crawlers at a 404)
- `get_taxonomy_url` on a multilingual site links to that language's term page (`/ko/tags/foo/`) when one exists — a term appearing only in non-default-language content previously linked to a root page that was never written
- **Release binaries could hang forever at exit.** `-Dpreview_mt` is deprecated in Crystal 1.21 and its legacy MT scheduler spins in the event loop's spin lock at process exit, so `hwaro build` never returned (measured 4/120 short-lived runs under CPU oversubscription). Parallelism now comes from Crystal's execution contexts, sized in `src/main.cr`
- Sass grouping parentheses no longer leak into declaration values (`width: (10px / 2)`, `margin: (1px 2px)`); a failing namespaced reference (`math.div(…)`) now warns with a `path:line:col` location instead of silently emitting invalid CSS
- GFM tables with short alignment delimiters (`|:--|--:|`, `|:-:|`, `| - |`) render as tables; the delimiter cell now matches GFM's `:?-+:?` instead of requiring three hyphens
- `hwaro tool check-links` stops reporting valid links as dead: angle-bracket destinations (`[t](</about/>)`, including ones containing spaces) and destinations with balanced parentheses (`/docs/foo_(bar)`)
- An oversized `[image_processing] widths` entry no longer aborts the build with a bare `OverflowError`; the variant is declined by the existing pixel-count guard instead
- A UTF-8 BOM no longer breaks parsing. Every parser hwaro hands file text to anchors on the first character, so a BOM'd file silently misbehaved: `.md` front matter fell through as body text (page titled "Untitled" with its literal `+++` block printed into the output), `config.toml` failed with `unexpected char '﻿' at 1:1`, and `.json`/`.toml` data files were warn-skipped until the render failed on the missing `site.data` key. Windows editors, "UTF-8 with BOM", and PowerShell `>` redirection all produce these files
- `slug` works on leaf bundles again (`<dir>/index.md`): the permalink resolver skipped it for every index page, so converting a page to bundle layout — what `hwaro new --bundle` and multilingual siblings produce — silently reverted its URL to the directory name. Section indexes (`_index.md`) are deliberately unaffected, since their directory name is the prefix their child pages derive their own URLs from
- `content/index.md` no longer republishes the entire `content/` tree. The homepage was treated as a page bundle spanning the whole site, so every non-Markdown file anywhere under `content/` (`private/internal.pdf`, `notes.txt`, `*.bak`) was copied into the output root — the `[content.files]` allowlist only guarded this when that section was present, and hand-written configs usually omit it. Recursion now also stops at nested `index.md`/`_index.md` instead of letting every ancestor index re-copy the same files
- `--minify` is no longer silently undone for `.json`/`.xml` files inside a page bundle: the minified output was written first and then overwritten by the verbatim bundle-asset copy
- Shortcode arguments accept an escaped quote (`caption="The \"big\" reveal"`). The value used to be truncated at the first `\"` — leaving a stray backslash — and a comma inside it re-split the argument list, dropping every argument that followed. `\\`, `\"` and `\'` are the only escapes, so `C:\new` and `\alpha` still round-trip verbatim
- `redirect_to` is prefixed with `base_url`'s path component, like `aliases` already was; on a project-pages deployment under a subpath the redirect previously pointed at the domain root and 404'd. External and protocol-relative targets are left untouched

- **A content path containing `..` silently destroyed the homepage.** `content/no..tes/index.md` or `content/a..b.md` had the offending segment *deleted* rather than refused, collapsing the page's URL to `/` — so it was written over `public/index.html`, with a success exit code, no warning, and a sitemap advertising a URL that 404s. Two such pages raced for the homepage, making the output nondeterministic. A segment that merely contains dots is an ordinary directory name and now publishes at its own URL; only a segment that traverses is refused, and the refusal is loud. The same silent relocation applied to a traversing `path`/`slug` in front matter and to traversing `aliases` entries — those are now refused with an actionable warning instead of being quietly rewritten to a cleaned path
- **`hwaro build -o <dir>/` (trailing slash) published a broken site and reported success.** The output guard compared against a path that still carried the separator, so every page, taxonomy and feed write was rejected — and the rejected path fell back to `<output>/index.html`, so each skipped page overwrote the site root in turn. The site shipped with static assets, a homepage containing some other page's markup, and exit 0. The guard now normalizes trailing/duplicate separators, and a rejected path is skipped instead of overwriting the root
- **`hwaro build -o content` recursively deleted the project's own sources.** The clean guard only refused `/`, `$HOME` and the cwd's ancestors, so a *child* of the project root passed straight through to `rm -rf`. `content`, `templates`, `static`, `data`, `i18n`, `themes`, `archetypes` and `.git` are now refused (`HWARO_E_CONFIG`); look-alike targets such as `-o contents` or `-o static-site` are unaffected
- `--cache` honours output-affecting build flags. `hwaro build --cache --minify` on a warm cache served unminified HTML indefinitely — the invalidation key was built from config and data only, so `--minify`, `--skip-highlighting`, `--skip-cache-busting`, `--skip-og-image` and `--skip-image-processing` never reached it. This is the combination the incremental-build docs recommend
- Listing pages no longer keep stale `[extra]`, `summary`, `word_count` or `reading_time` values under `--cache`: the page-set fingerprint omitted them, so a homepage or section index that displayed them was frozen at the first build. The fingerprint widens only for sites whose listing templates actually read those fields, and reads qualified by `page.`/`section.` (the current page's own values) do not trigger it — the built-in scaffolds rebuild exactly as many pages as before
- `--cache` re-copies a static file whose mtime moved *backwards* (`git checkout` of an older branch, `git stash pop`, `rsync --times`). The incremental copy skipped any source not newer than its destination, with no content check, so the stale asset was served forever. Copies now carry the source mtime and are compared for equality
- A `.hwaro_cache.json` shared between two `-o` targets no longer leaves the older tree permanently stale: cache entries validated the output only with `File.exists?`, so a CI job building prod and staging from one checkout stopped updating whichever tree it had not just written
- `hwaro serve` sent the full 404 page as the body of a `HEAD` request, desynchronising keep-alive connections — a second pipelined request on the same connection got no response at all. `HEAD` now also reports the same `Content-Length` its matching `GET` would return, including the injected live-reload script
- `hwaro serve` dropped `; charset=utf-8` from text responses of 32 KiB or more (`search.json`, `llms.txt`, large CSS/JS): the charset was patched onto `Content-Type` after the response body had already flushed the headers. Text MIME types now carry the charset from the start, at any size
- `hwaro serve -b ::1` (any IPv6 bind) baked an unbracketed `http://::1:PORT` into the serve receipt, the ready signal and every generated link, so the dev site rendered unstyled with dead links. IPv6 literals are now bracketed everywhere a URL appears
- `hwaro serve --no-error-overlay` genuinely suppresses the in-browser overlay; the flag only reached the per-page render-error HTML, so the full-screen "Build failed" panel still covered the page
- `hwaro serve --base-url http://host/prefix/` mounts the site under that prefix instead of building prefixed URLs and serving them at the root — previously every stylesheet, script and internal link 404'd, making a project-pages deployment impossible to preview. `/` redirects to the mount point, unprefixed requests still resolve, and live reload, the watcher and the WebSocket endpoint work under the prefix
- CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) responses now carry `Cache-Control: no-store` and any `--header` / `[serve.headers]` values, which the docs already promised for *every* dev-server response
- Directory redirects emit a percent-encoded `Location` (`/my%20page/`, `/%ED%95%9C%EA%B8%80/`) instead of raw spaces and raw UTF-8 bytes, and a path that sanitizes to nothing (`/%00`) no longer redirects to the malformed `Location: //`
- The dev server no longer serves URL aliases that a static host 404s (`/guide%5Cindex.html`, `/%2Fguide%2Findex.html`), which made a broken link work locally and break after deploy. Percent-encoded unicode paths are unaffected — `/한글/` resolves raw and encoded
- Unsupported HTTP methods get `405 Method Not Allowed` with `Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS` instead of the 404 page
- Deleting `public/` while `hwaro serve` is running recovers on the first save: the rebuild escalates to a full build instead of failing every page with a confusing temp-file error and needing a second save
- **`hwaro tool check-links` reported every `/<lang>/…` link as dead on a multilingual site** — 288 of 576 links on hwaro's own docs — because target resolution never stripped a language prefix and never probed `<name>.<lang>.md`. Exit 1 made it unusable as a CI gate on the very site the scaffold generates
- **`hwaro tool unused-assets --delete` permanently deleted assets that were in use.** Only `templates/**/*.{html,css,js}` and `static/**/*.{css,js}` were scanned for references, so an asset referenced from a `.jinja`/`.j2`/`.ecr` template, a `.scss` file, a feed `.xml`, a `.webmanifest` or an `.svg` was reported unused and removed. Scanning is now widened to every source that can reference an asset
- `hwaro tool check-links` also checks reference-style links (`[t][ref]` + `[ref]: /dest/`) and raw HTML `<a href>` / `<img src>`, which it previously did not discover at all — a page full of HTML images got a clean bill of health. Footnote definitions, prose-bodied definitions and template expressions are excluded
- `hwaro tool check-links` skips a file with invalid UTF-8 instead of aborting the whole scan with a bare `Regex match error`, exit 1 (indistinguishable from "dead links found") and an empty `--json` document
- `hwaro doctor` recognizes `.jinja`/`.j2`/`.ecr` templates: a site whose templates use those extensions built fine but was reported as missing every required template (exit 4), and real syntax errors in them were never detected
- `hwaro doctor --fix` / `--approve` / `--full` run the diagnostics and gate on what they could not fix; they previously printed only the fix summary and always exited 0, so a CI step of `hwaro doctor --fix` passed on a broken site
- `hwaro tool stats` and `hwaro tool validate` no longer swallow a body that begins with `---`: after TOML front matter was stripped, the YAML-front-matter regex matched the body's own leading thematic break and deleted the first block, so its words went uncounted and its images were never checked for alt text
- `hwaro tool stats` word counts match the `page.word_count` and reading time the site itself publishes (measured 30% apart); both now share one counting implementation
- `hwaro tool list`, `stats` and `validate` strip ANSI/control bytes from content-supplied titles, tags and messages before printing, and the tables align correctly for CJK and emoji titles instead of measuring them one column wide
- `hwaro tool list` fails with `HWARO_E_CONTENT` when the content directory does not exist, instead of printing an error on stderr, `[]` on stdout and exiting 0
- A UTF-8 BOM no longer defeats front-matter detection in every importer and both exporters: title, date, tags and draft status were silently lost, the raw front matter leaked into the page body, and the Jekyll exporter misfiled the post as a page
- Importers no longer silently drop content when two source files resolve to the same destination. WordPress, Hugo, Hexo, Obsidian and Astro had no collision handling — one file vanished, and `--force` clobbered it while still counting it as imported. Collisions now disambiguate with a warning, `--force` means "overwrite files that pre-date this import", and re-imports stay idempotent
- A symlink cycle anywhere under the source tree (`ln -s .. notes/loop`) no longer aborts the entire import with a raw `Too many levels of symbolic links` and zero files written
- Hugo page-bundle imports and exports carry the bundle's co-located assets, so `![](cover.png)` inside an imported bundle no longer 404s
- The WordPress importer indents nested `<ul>`/`<ol>` lists instead of flattening them onto the parent item's line (`- b- b1`), which rendered as a single list item containing literal markup
- `hwaro tool convert` reports why it failed. A missing content directory produced exit 1 with no diagnostic at all in human mode, while `--json` printed the real cause
- The Hugo importer carries `authors` across (previously dropped, so `hwaro → hugo export → hugo import` lost attribution), and the Eleventy importer maps the site root `index.md` to `content/index.md` instead of burying it at `content/posts/index.md` — or dropping it entirely when it had no title
- The Jekyll exporter emits `layout:` rather than hwaro's `template:`, so exported sites render with their layout and round-trip back through the importer
- YAML front matter written for export escapes non-printable codepoints in the fixed-width `\xXX`/`\uXXXX`/`\UXXXXXXXX` forms YAML accepts, instead of Crystal's `\u{…}` brace form, which Jekyll's parser rejects
- The Obsidian importer keeps the filename as alt text for a sized embed (`![[diagram.png|300]]`) instead of using the display width as the alt attribute
- **`hwaro init --wizard --scaffold blog` created a stray directory named `blog`** and used the simple scaffold: the wizard's positional scan treated a flag's *value* as the target path. `--wizard` also discarded every other flag, so a user who passed `--force` was told to pass `--force` after answering all the prompts. Flags are now parsed first and the wizard fills only what was not supplied
- `hwaro deploy` warns when `include` / `exclude` / `strip_index_html` cannot be applied. They were silently ignored for `s3://`, `gs://`, `az://` and `command` targets, so files the author explicitly excluded were uploaded anyway
- `hwaro init` failures use the documented error taxonomy: a non-empty target, an unknown `--scaffold`/`--agents` value and a malformed remote source now exit 2 (`HWARO_E_USAGE`), and filesystem failures exit 6 (`HWARO_E_IO`), instead of a bare `Error:` and exit 1. A malformed remote source is also rejected before the target directory is created
- The `bare` scaffold's opt-out is no longer dead code: its default config still enabled taxonomies, search and highlighting, producing a dead `search.json`, three empty taxonomy pages rendered by the section fallback, and a JSON-LD `SearchAction` pointing at nothing
- `hwaro init --minimal-config --include-multilingual en,ko` no longer prints a false "ignoring `--include-multilingual`" warning — the languages were generated correctly all along, and following the warning produced a duplicate-key config
- `hwaro new "notes/"` creates a page inside that section. The trailing slash — the one unambiguous "this is a directory" signal — was stripped before the decision, so the command meant different things depending on whether the directory already existed, and the second page in a new section was a hard error
- `hwaro init` rejects extra positional arguments and honours `--`, instead of silently scaffolding an unquoted multi-word name into a directory called `My`
- `hwaro completion` usage errors exit 2 with a classified message, matching the documented taxonomy
- `--list-scaffolds` / `--list-archetypes` no longer swallow invalid flags alongside them (a mistyped `--json` yielded human text and exit 0), and `-j` is accepted as `--json` on `init` and `new` as it already was on `deploy`
- `hwaro init .` works in a directory holding only VCS/OS metadata (`.git`, `.gitignore`, `.DS_Store`, …) — `git init` followed by `hwaro init .` was refused as "not empty"
- `hwaro new` warns when an archetype overrides a customized `[content.new] front_matter_format` / `default_fields`, which every scaffolded project silently did because it ships `archetypes/default.md`
- **A long site title crashed PNG OG image generation with a segfault.** The renderer writes through a raw pointer and only clipped the far edge of the canvas, but several coordinates are a fixed edge minus a *measured* text width, so a long `title` pushed the write cursor to a negative offset — silent heap corruption at a few thousand characters, `Invalid memory access (signal 11)` past a few hundred thousand. Every rectangle fill now clips both ends, and coordinates derived from text measurement saturate instead of raising `OverflowError`
- A page or site title whose bytes end mid-UTF-8-sequence no longer makes the font renderer read past the end of the string. Front matter is not UTF-8 validated, and the C measure/render decoders advanced by the sequence's nominal length, stepping over the string's terminator
- **A self-referencing YAML anchor (`x: &a` / `b: *a`) in front matter or a data file killed the build with `Stack overflow`.** Crystal's YAML parser accepts it and returns a *cyclic* value, so every recursive converter over that value ran until the stack died — unrescuable, exit 11, from two lines of a document. A source-nesting limit cannot see a cycle, so the guard now lives in the traversal: front matter reports `HWARO_E_CONTENT` like any other malformed block, and a data file is skipped with a warning
- **A run of 44,000+ `-`, `*` or `_` on one line aborted the build** with `Regex::Error: JIT stack limit reached`. Markd matches thematic breaks with nested quantifiers, so PCRE2 recursed once per marker character — and the block parser offers every line to that rule, so a machine-generated separator or a pasted log divider was enough. Matching is now a linear scan with identical CommonMark semantics
- Sass no longer hangs on runaway loops or selector nesting. `@for` had no iteration cap at all (`@for $i from 1 through 100000000` emitted rules until memory ran out) and per-loop caps do not survive nesting, so `@for`/`@each`/`@while` now share one budget. Separately, `&` in a deeply nested rule compounds the parent cross-product (10 → 10² → 10⁴ → 10⁸ selectors from eight lines of SCSS); the expansion is cost-checked before it is built

### Changed
- **Breaking (rendering):** a page bundle directly under `content/` (`content/about-bundle/index.md`) renders with `templates/page.html` instead of `templates/index.html`. It was being treated as the site homepage, so such a page published the homepage layout — hero, "Latest posts" listing and all — with its own body embedded in it. The real homepage (`content/index.md`) is unaffected. Sites using a top-level bundle will see that page's markup change on the first rebuild
- **Breaking (rendering):** `{% raw %}` in Markdown content now suppresses shortcode expansion inside the block, as it always should have. The change propagates to derived artifacts, so pages using `{% raw %}` in prose will also see churn in `rss.xml` and `search.json` on the first rebuild
- A symlinked output directory (`ln -s /var/www/site public`) is published *through* instead of being replaced: the cold build used to delete the link and leave a real directory in its place, so every later build published where nobody deploys. The published bytes are identical; what changes is the on-disk shape of `public`. Because the clean now reaches the link's target, the resolved destination is logged once before anything is removed
- Taxonomy term slugs are capped at 245 bytes (a filesystem name limit is 255), with a digest suffix keeping distinct terms on distinct URLs, and the truncation is reported by a warning naming the term. Terms at or under the cap — every term on every existing site — keep their exact URL
- `hwaro build` and `hwaro build --minify` emit identical page bytes for a page carrying a NUL byte (reachable through a data-file value). NUL is invalid in HTML text and is now dropped by the render phase on both paths; previously only `--minify` removed it, so an optional whitespace pass silently changed page content
- **Breaking (packagers):** minimum Crystal is now 1.21, and no build path passes `-Dpreview_mt` any more. Worker count still honours `CRYSTAL_WORKERS` (now defaulting to the CPU count)
- The automatic render-worker count now follows the site's **listing fan-out** instead of `cpu_count * 2`. What caps useful render parallelism is how many page objects one page render materializes from a site-wide collection — every `{% for p in site.pages %}` / `section.pages` iteration allocates per item, and past a small worker count Boehm's global allocation lock serializes that work while extra workers add only contention. The old CPU-derived default sat on the worst point of that curve on a 14-core machine, and the curves invert between workloads so no fixed value replaces it: on a 5000-page site whose `page` template lists every page, 28 workers cost **2.5x** (48.6s → 19.4s), while a 5000-page site with no per-page listing wanted *more* workers, not fewer (0.998s → 0.792s). Sites are now rendered with 1 worker at 500+ items materialized per page, 2 at 100-499, and up to 4 below that; a homepage that lists every page does not count against this, since the estimate is the mean across rendered pages rather than the max. `--jobs N` still overrides the heuristic outright, and output is byte-identical at every worker count
- `hwaro tool convert` names the files whose front-matter comments it drops. The blanket "comments are not preserved" notice fired on every run and identified nothing, so an in-place rewrite across hundreds of files gave no clue what it cost
- Several failure paths moved off the legacy `Error:` / exit 1 form onto the documented taxonomy: `hwaro init` (non-empty target, bad `--scaffold`/`--agents`/remote source, extra positionals → exit 2; filesystem failures → exit 6), `hwaro completion` (missing or unknown shell → exit 2), `hwaro build --memory-limit` (invalid value → exit 2), `hwaro tool list` (missing content directory → exit 5), `hwaro tool convert` (missing content directory → exit 6), and `hwaro build -o <project source dir>` (refused → exit 3). `hwaro doctor --fix|--approve|--full` now exits non-zero when issues remain, so a CI step that was passing on a broken site will start failing
- `hwaro init --scaffold bare` produces a smaller site: no `[[taxonomies]]`, `[search]` or `[highlight]` in `config.toml`, and no `search.json`, `/tags/`, `/categories/` or `/authors/` in the output. Other scaffolds are byte-identical
- `hwaro tool stats` word counts and `hwaro tool check-links` link counts change, in both cases because the old numbers were wrong — stats now agrees with the site's own `page.word_count`, and check-links discovers reference-style and raw-HTML links it previously ignored
- Files copied from `static/` into the output now carry the source file's mtime rather than the copy time. Content is unchanged, and output mtimes become stable across rebuilds
- The first `hwaro build --cache` after upgrading re-renders everything once, because the invalidation key gained a build-options component
- Importing sources that collide on one destination now produces `slug.md` plus `slug-1.md`, reported as one summary line at the end of the run (per-file detail moved behind `--verbose`), where one file used to be silently discarded. Anything grepping for `Destination collision:` should match `destination(s) renamed` instead. The walk is now sorted, so which file carries the suffix is reproducible rather than filesystem-order dependent
- Jekyll exports carry `layout:` instead of `template:`; Eleventy imports place the site root `index.md` at the content root and map a collection landing page (`blog/index.md`) to `content/blog/_index.md` instead of dropping it
- `hwaro tool check-links` reports a `/<lang>/…` link as dead when only the default-language source exists — previously it resolved against the untranslated page and passed. Expect it to surface real broken links on multilingual sites. A `/<code>/` prefix is only treated as a language when the code is 2-3 lowercase letters, matching what the build can actually route (so `pt-BR` is not mistaken for one), and a real section named like a language (`content/ko/`) resolves again
- `hwaro doctor` accepts the template names the build actually honours (`page.jinja`, `page.j2`) and reports the ones it ignores (`page.html.jinja`, and templates that exist only in a subdirectory). Both directions were previously inverted
- `hwaro tool validate --json` message strings carry the author's original bytes; zero-width and bidi characters were being stripped from the model, so a consumer could not match the tag it was told about. Terminal output still strips control characters
- `hwaro doctor --fix|--approve|--full --json` gains `schema_version`, `issues`, `summary` and `exit_code`; existing keys are unchanged
- `hwaro build` reports `built:` as the number of pages actually written, and adds a `skipped:` row (and a `pages_not_published` JSON field) when a page could not be published. Sites with URL collisions or `render = false` pages therefore report a smaller, truer number
- `hwaro serve` mounts a `--base-url` subpath even when the startup build failed, keeps the mount point on redirects it canonicalises, sends `charset=utf-8` on HTML of any size, 404s URL aliases a static host would refuse (`%2F`, `%5C`, NUL) in both mounted and unmounted shapes, includes the mount point in the machine-readable ready URL, and logs the original request path
- The shared path sanitizer (`PathUtils.sanitize_path`, used by importers, remote scaffolds, feeds and taxonomies) now drops a segment only when it is nothing but dots and spaces, instead of any segment containing `..`. Dotted directory names are preserved rather than flattened — an imported `content/no..tes/post.md` lands at `no..tes/post.md` instead of colliding at the section root — and `". "` is now rejected as well, since Windows normalizes it to `.`. Every traversal form the old rule neutralized stays neutralized (`..`, `%2e%2e`, `%252e%252e`, `....//`, backslash and mixed forms)

## v0.18.1

### Added
- Sass color functions: `darken`/`lighten`, `saturate`/`desaturate`, `grayscale`, `complement`, `adjust-hue`, `mix`, `invert`, `opacify`/`transparentize`, `adjust-color`/`scale-color`/`change-color`, the channel getters, and the `sass:color` module. They previously fell through as literal text, emitting invalid CSS (#712)
- `hwaro -v` as a short alias for `--version` (#711)

### Fixed
- A bare `&` in prose no longer swallows every inline construct up to the next `;` in the same block. Entity references now follow CommonMark — a name from the HTML5 list plus a trailing `;`, anything else is literal text. Also fixes a build-aborting `IndexError` on the input `&;` (#717)
- `--cache` invalidates when the hwaro binary changes: cached pages were keyed only on their inputs, so a rendering fix never reached an incrementally-built site until something else happened to change (#717)
- Numeric character references above U+10FFF decode correctly instead of becoming `�` — emoji, CJK Ext B and beyond, math alphanumerics (#719)
- A long numeric character reference in a link destination, link title, or fence info string no longer aborts the build with `ArgumentError`, and a semicolon-less one (`&#38`) stays literal (#719)
- AMP: `<iframe>` sandboxing is origin-aware — same-origin and relative `src`es no longer get `allow-same-origin`, which AMP forbids and which failed validation (#712)
- Multilingual scaffolds: the blog homepage/archives listings and the book sidebar TOC scope to the current language instead of mixing every language's content (#712)
- The shared `alert` shortcode template honors its documented `title` parameter instead of silently dropping it (#712)

### Changed
- Homebrew tap formula auto-publishes after a release build again (#710)

## v0.18.0

### Added
- Built-in Sass/SCSS compilation (`[sass]`) — pure Crystal, no external tools: variables, nesting with `&`, partials via `@use`/`@forward`/`@import`, mixins with `@content`, user `@function`s, control flow (`@if`/`@each`/`@for`/`@while`), SassScript expressions, a curated `sass:math`/`string`/`list`/`map`/`meta` built-in set, `@at-root`, and `@media`/`@supports` bubbling. `static/**/*.scss` compiles to sibling `.css`, bundle entries compile before concatenation, and `serve` recompiles on change. Plain CSS compiles byte-identically; unsupported: `@extend`, color functions, unit conversion, indented syntax, source maps (#700, #706)
- Hugo-style token permalinks: `[permalinks]` values may use `:year`/`:month`/`:day`/`:slug`/`:title`/`:section`/`:filename` (`"posts" = "/:year/:month/:day/:slug/"`); plain values keep directory-remap semantics (#701)
- Custom feed templates: `templates/rss.xml.jinja` / `atom.xml.jinja` override the built-in markup for every feed kind (#701)
- `[links] broken_internal = "error"`: fail the build with one aggregated list of unresolved `@/` links (#701)
- Markdown render hooks for blockquotes and tables (`render-blockquote.html`, `render-table.html`) (#702)
- Taxonomy sorting: per-taxonomy `sort_by`/`reverse` for pages, `terms_sort_by` (`name`/`count`) for the terms list (#702)
- `[highlight] copy = true`: dependency-free copy-to-clipboard button on code blocks, with per-fence `{copy=…}` overrides (#702)
- Fence options `{hide_lines="1 9-12"}` to elide lines and `{name="main.cr"}` for a filename label (#702, #696)
- Opt-in markdown flags: `smart_punctuation`, `containers` (`:::note`), `task_list_classes`, external-link policy (`target_blank`/`no_follow`/`no_referrer`), plus site-wide `insert_anchor_links` (#696)
- Multi-line footnotes and definition lists (#696)
- Unknown top-level config keys now warn with a did-you-mean suggestion instead of being silently ignored (#692)
- Korean documentation at `/ko/` with a language switcher and language-scoped search (#705)

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `[highlight] mode` defaults to `"server"` — code blocks are highlighted at build time (same `hljs-*` classes, theme CSS keeps working) and `{{ highlight_js }}` renders empty. Set `mode = "client"` to restore browser-side Highlight.js; all pages re-render once after upgrading (#702)
- `get_taxonomy().items` is name-sorted by default instead of insertion order; use `terms_sort_by = "count"` for count-descending (#702)
- Terminal output redesigned to a minimal "spark" identity: whitespace-driven layout, no rules or dividers, a single `✦` outcome line. `--json`, `--quiet`, and plain/`NO_COLOR` output are unchanged (#699)
- Scaffolds modernized under Ember: glass mastheads, view transitions, reading progress, active sidebar/nav state, prev-next navigation (#693)
- `markdownify` honors the site's markdown options (safe mode, smart punctuation) instead of bare defaults (#696)

### Fixed
- `hwaro serve` stability audit (29 findings): un-drafting a page during serve publishes it, slug/path edits delete stale output, deleted sections remove their `index.html`, failed rebuilds show the overlay instead of live-reloading a half-built site, and `data/`/`i18n/` are watched (#698, #692)
- `hwaro new` hardening: path traversal via sanitizer-synthesized dots, silently-unrendered hidden paths, unparseable `--date`, dropped extra positional args, and flat pages colliding with an existing bundle (#697)
- Markdown rendering audit: blockquoted fences, indented-code protection, shortcode placeholders in table cells/definitions/footnotes, math delimiters, and `<!-- more -->` splitting (#695)
- Multilingual prev/next builds its reading order per language, so `page.lower`/`page.higher` never cross into another language's tree; equal-weight subsections use the same path tiebreak as top-level sections (#705, #703)
- Sass dart-sass parity audit (~35 fixes): `$=` attribute selectors, escaped characters in selectors and `url()`, structured values through variables, small-number and `round()`/`min()`/`max()` serialization, document order for `@layer`/`@use`/`@import`, `& + &` cross-products, `@at-root` scoping, and module privacy (#707, #708)
- `[auto_includes]` links SCSS-compiled stylesheets (an SCSS-only site previously shipped unstyled) and `.scss` sources feed the `?v=` cache-bust digest (#708)
- Feeds: basename-normalized self URLs, shared URL-collision winner selection across main/section/language/taxonomy feeds, and `OutputGuard` path safety (#703, #708)
- Token permalinks no longer abort the build for dateless pages that never publish (drafts, expired/future, `render: false`) (#703)
- `get_taxonomy` and term feeds exclude draft and preview-only pages, matching the written taxonomy pages (#708)
- Menu `mailto:`/`tel:` URLs stay external instead of being rewritten to `/mailto:…/`; external-link policy honors uppercase schemes (#708)
- Images resize in sRGB color space, fixing darkened edges and thin lines on downscale (#692)
- `hwaro tool platform`: alias extraction skips headless/out-of-window pages so generation no longer fails where the build succeeds (#703)

### Performance
- Server-side syntax highlighting runs in parallel — the Tartrazine shared-state hazards are fixed at the source, with tokenization bounded at 4 slots to avoid GC allocation-lock convoying (#694)

## v0.17.1

### Changed
- Auto OG images redesigned: bundled Space Grotesk + JetBrains Mono with Latin/CJK fallback chains, seven reworked pattern styles, ember default palette (#687)
- Scaffolds refreshed under the ember identity (`simple`/`blog`/`docs`/`book`; `bare` untouched) (#687)
- Documentation site rebuilt on the ember design system: dark-default with light toggle, breadcrumbs/prev-next, server-side highlighting, self-hosted fonts (#685)

### Fixed
- `hwaro serve`: rewriting templates mid-rebuild no longer breaks the served site — snapshot-consistent `{% include %}`/`{% extends %}`, output-format edits re-render, SEO surfaces refresh, atomic-save temp files ignored (#688)
- `hwaro doctor --fix`: hardened against cross-section corruption — `[[array.of.tables]]` headers no longer leak `[sitemap]` state, `--full` is idempotent, `--approve` adds sections while `--fix` normalizes values (#689)
- `hwaro deploy`: hardened against error-swallowing and stale deletes — classified errors under `--dry-run --json`, no stranded deletions, single-pass placeholder expansion, symlink/overlap safety (#690)
- `hwaro tool`: 50+ fixes across `convert`/`export`/`import`, analysis tools, and platform generators — front-matter preservation, zone-bearing dates, false-positive removal, working CI configs; shared `Utils::FrontmatterWriter` (#691)
- `[outputs].sections` scopes `section` output only, not page-level formats
- `--include-future`/`--include-expired` are preview flags: admitted pages render but stay out of sitemap, feeds, search index, llms.txt, and listings
- Canonical/`og:url`/hreflang percent-encode non-ASCII paths, matching feeds/sitemap
- Taxonomy terms (tags/authors/aliases) whitespace-trimmed at parse time
- Auto OG images skip undrawable codepoints (emoji) instead of rendering tofu boxes
- Heading render hook + `{#id .class}` no longer leaves a doubled space
- Fence options reject `linenostart=0` / `hl_lines="0"` instead of clamping to line 1
- Duplicate explicit `{#id}` heading ids warn when renamed (`#dup` → `#dup-1`)
- CLI polish: singular/plural agreement for 1-item counts; clearer `tool convert` / `unused-assets --help` text

## v0.17.0

### Added
- `[outputs]` config: extra per-page/section output formats (`json`, `txt`, `xml`, `csv`) from user `templates/page.<fmt>.jinja` / `section.<fmt>.jinja`, overridable per page via a front-matter `outputs` key (cascades), exposed as `{{ alternate_output_tags }}`, cache-aware under `--cache`
- Markdown render hooks: `templates/hooks/render-{link,image,heading,codeblock}.html` override element rendering (Hugo/Zola-style), no-op when absent; existing `@/`/shortcode/`srcset`/anchor resolvers still run. See [Render Hooks](https://hwaro.hahwul.com/templates/render-hooks/)
- Fenced code block options after the language (`{linenos=true, hl_lines="2-4 7", linenostart=5}`) plus `[highlight] line_numbers`; `mode = "server"` bakes the result at build time, `mode = "client"` emits `data-*` attributes
- Opt-in inline markup behind `[markdown]` flags (off by default): `ins` (`++`), `mark` (`==`), `sub` (`~`), `sup` (`^`)
- Generalized `{#id .class key=val}` attribute blocks on headings and inline images (`[markdown] attributes`)
- First-class menu system (Hugo-style): `[[menus.<name>]]`, per-language overrides, front-matter registration; exposed via `site.menus`/`get_menu()` with an `active_path` filter; `doctor` validates undefined parents and menu names
- `hwaro init --wizard` and `hwaro new` (no `<path>`) open interactive terminal wizards; archetypes gain a `{{ description }}` placeholder
- Scaffold design tokens ("Hwaro Ember" `:root` with `light-dark()` pairs, fluid type/space scales) and a header theme switcher (auto → light → dark, persisted, flash-free) across every styled scaffold
- `just scaffold-previews`: regenerate docs scaffold screenshots headlessly

### Changed
- `hwaro init` initializes immediately with defaults; `--wizard` opens the interactive flow (removed `-y`/`--yes`)
- Terminal output: the remaining commands (`list`/`stats`/`validate`/`check-links`/`deploy`/`export`/`import`/`unused-assets`/`convert`/`platform`/`agents-md`) adopt the ember language and shared glyph set; machine surfaces (`--json`, `serve` ready line, `--version`, exit codes) are byte-for-byte unchanged
- Scaffold design pass across docs/blog/book (~1,600 lines of duplicated dark CSS deleted)

### Removed
- The `blog-dark`, `docs-dark`, and `book-dark` scaffolds — scaffolds follow the OS scheme and ship a manual switcher; pin one permanently with `:root { color-scheme: dark; }` in `css/style.css`

### Fixed
- macOS release binaries shipped as portable `.tar.gz` archives with bundled OpenSSL, dropping the hardcoded Homebrew `openssl@3` dependency
- Shortcodes: Jinja control tags (`{% if %}`, `{% set %}`) in block bodies no longer desync the nesting scan; mixed positional + named args no longer drop the positional value
- PWA service worker: offline→root navigation fallback restored across all three cache strategies
- `llms-full.txt` honors `in_search_index = false`
- Internal `@/` links with a query string or anchor no longer double-escape `&`
- `hwaro serve`: `authors` front-matter edits update the taxonomy incrementally; equal-weight sections keep a stable prev/next order
- `--cache`: deleting a page regenerates the sitemap/feeds/search index even when no surviving page re-rendered
- Parallel builds surface sitemap/feed/search failures instead of exiting 0; closed section-list and shortcode-init fiber-safety gaps under `-Dpreview_mt`
- AMP: `<img>` with `>` inside a quoted attribute value converts without corrupting the markup

### Performance
- Flat N-page sites avoid an O(N²) render cost — section-page arrays and SEO/OG/canonical/JSON-LD strings are built only when the template's static closure can reach them
- Parallel render workers read prewarmed Crinja caches lock-free (`-Dpreview_mt`); taxonomy generation reuses the running Builder instead of a second O(N) Crinja pass
- Markdown skips footnote/definition-list passes when the markers are absent; builds no longer run the markdown pipeline twice (dropped the legacy hook pre-pass)
- JS minification is no longer O(n²) on non-ASCII files (128KB CJK bundle: 59.5s → 9.6ms); HTML minifier compiles protected-tag patterns once at startup
- `--cache`: touched-but-identical files re-hashed once, page-bundle assets no longer recopied, lock-free hit/miss counters; `serve` incremental rebuilds render the affected set in parallel
- 404 page reuses render-phase template vars; `--stream` builds per-worker engines once per run; `load_data()` memoized per file mtime

## v0.16.0

### Added
- Section `[cascade]` front matter: defaults inherited by descendant pages and sections (Hugo-style); nearer cascades and a page's own keys win, `extra`/`taxonomies` merge per key, and cached/serve builds invalidate affected descendants
- `[highlight] mode = "server"`: build-time syntax highlighting via Tartrazine (250+ languages, pure Crystal). Emits Highlight.js-compatible classes (existing hljs themes keep working) and ships zero JavaScript; default stays `"client"`
- Template dependency tracking: editing a template only rebuilds the pages that render it, in `--cache` builds and `hwaro serve`; opt out with `[build] template_deps = false`
- `page.taxonomies` template variable and Zola-style `[taxonomies]` front-matter tables
- OG styles `terminal`, `bauhaus`, `halftone`, plus upgraded `artistic`/`hero`/`surreal` renders
- `hwaro build --jobs N`: cap parallel render concurrency (#655)

### Changed
- Terminal output redesign ("ember" identity): `build`/`serve`/`init`/`new`/`doctor` share one warm visual language — a live status line collapses into an aligned receipt ending on a single ember outcome line; humanized durations. Machine output (`--json`, the `serve` ready line, `--quiet`, `NO_COLOR`/non-TTY) is byte-for-byte unchanged; scripts grepping human stdout should switch to `--json` (#637)
- `init`/`new` scaffolds unified under the ember identity (#624)
- Template errors report `templates/<file>:line:col` with a caret-marked source excerpt instead of an anonymous `<string>` template
- Docs redesign: collapsible sidebar, header search trigger, command-palette

### Fixed
- Security: hardened importers (path traversal, entity DoS), dev-server CORS, and redirect/report sinks (#643); closed symlink-exfil, WS-origin, and `rm_rf` gaps (#623)
- Dogfood sweeps: 40+ correctness fixes across feeds, markdown, SEO, AMP, PWA, scaffolds, permalinks, and tooling (#640, #641); `--cache` listing-page staleness (#642)
- Friends audit: llms/search/feed discovery surfaces, taxonomy SEO registration, feed absolutization, and CJK-capable OG fonts (#648, #650, #651, #652)
- Markdown: fence tracking, pass ordering, code-span/table-cell corruption, math-span emphasis, unquoted YAML dates, and table code-span pipes (#638)
- Taxonomies: `get_taxonomy` slugs match written pages for drafts and non-default-language terms; closed the authors-taxonomy gap
- `slugify` lowercases uppercase Unicode letters (#639); OG cache invalidates when logo/background file contents change; `get_section().pages` honors the section's `sort_by`; `hwaro serve` removes orphaned output when a watched source is deleted
- `tool export jekyll` preserves the `authors` field (#645); `tool unused-assets --delete` honored in JSON mode plus a new `--force` (#647); Astro singular `author` mapped to `authors` on import (#646)
- Latent-bug and stability audits across subsystems: 10+ edge-case fixes (parse-time, falsy bools, minifier overflow, XML CDATA, etc.) (#620, #653)

### Performance
- Render: per-page template hash computed once, O(1) current-page exclusion in section lists, cache bookkeeping skipped when caching is off
- Feeds/search: memoized fallback markdown renders shared between the two surfaces

## v0.15.3

### Changed
- Homebrew: tap now ships a prebuilt-binary formula; macOS binary pinned to `openssl@3` (was EOL `openssl@1.1`) so it launches on a clean machine (#615)

### Fixed
- Subpath deploys: root-relative content links are prefixed with the `base_url` path, fixing 404s in pages, feeds, and `search.json` (#616)
- Book scaffold: site root index now leads prev/next order; nav links carry `base_url` under subpath deploys (#616)
- Taxonomies: a configured taxonomy always renders its index page, even with zero terms (#616)
- Feeds & search: title-less root index falls back to the site title instead of emitting an empty title (#616)
- Scaffold a11y & safety: skip-to-content link, focus rings, search `aria-label`, AA-contrast dark text, and `| e`-escaped author titles (#616)
- Alert shortcode: translucent accent tint so it's readable on dark scaffolds (#616)
- Parallel render: shortcode templates cached per-worker, fixing an intermittent `HWARO_E_TEMPLATE` race (#619)
- `hwaro new`: bundle bare paths no longer collapse to `index.md`; `--section` path handling improved (#617)
- `hwaro init`: remote scaffolds without `config.toml` fall back to a generated config; MT-safe directory creation (#617)

## v0.15.2

### Added
- `[static]` config: filter which `static/` files get published — built-in cruft denylist (`.DS_Store`, `.git/`, etc.), `exclude` glob patterns, and `use_default_excludes = false` to opt out (#611)

### Fixed
- Static files: hidden dot-paths (e.g. `.well-known/`) now published in cached (`--cache`) builds, matching cold builds (#610)

## v0.15.1

### Fixed
- SEO: `og:type` and JSON-LD schema now distinguish page-bundle leaves from section landings, so bundle sites no longer label every page `website`/`WebSite`; a new `home?` helper detects homepages (#608, #601)
- Scaffold nav: nav-hint comment no longer leaks a `{% raw %}` delimiter into generated pages (#609)

## v0.15.0

### Added
- `hwaro serve`: custom response headers via `--header 'Name: Value'` (repeatable) and `[serve.headers]`
- Shortcodes: named closer support (`{% alert %}...{% endalert %}`) with mismatch diagnostics
- `[og.auto_image] lazy_generate = true`: defer OG image generation during `hwaro serve` (great with `--fast-start`)
- `hwaro init --full-config`: emit verbose recommended config for discoverability
- New OG styles (`split`, `band`, `brutalist`, `artistic`, `hero`, `surreal`, `monument`) in PNG and SVG; new `secondary_color`, `text_panel`, `accent_bars` options
- Responsive content images: markdown images with width variants auto-rewritten with `srcset`/`sizes` when `[image_processing]` is on (#587)
- Blog theme: post template renders a Related Posts block when `[related]` is enabled (#593)

### Changed
- `hwaro init`/`doctor`: hybrid config strategy — `init` emits a much shorter config (~67 vs ~389 lines); doctor less aggressive by default
- `doctor`: `--fix` does corrective fixes only; new `--approve` adds optional sections; `--full` = `--fix --approve`; removed `--minimal`
- Auto OG images default to PNG instead of SVG (social platforms don't render SVG `og:image`), falling back to SVG (#583)
- OG images: pattern-style accent bars off by default (`accent_bars = true` to restore); SVG renderer now honors the flag

### Fixed
- `hwaro init`/`doctor`: restored multilingual support and removed duplicate `[sitemap]`/`[feeds]` emission
- `tool check-links`: recognizes assets in `static/`/`public/`, removing false positives
- Render: `site.sections` Crinja values expose `weight`, `draft`, `transparent`, `sort_by`, etc.
- `hwaro new`: `--section` takes precedence over path-based inference
- Authoring UX fixes (multilingual nav, doctor dedup, draft messaging, default `new` dates, social meta fallbacks)
- OG hex colors (3-/8-digit), HTML minifier `IndexError`, and `CacheManager#save` mutex hardening (#568)
- OG images: `band`-style long titles capped to fitting lines; CJK-without-font warning; Twitter card downgrades to `summary` when imageless (#569)
- Section `page_template` now applied to child pages; explicit page templates still win (#570)
- `tool convert`: date-only values keep their calendar day across formats; timestamps still round-trip as RFC 3339 (#571)
- `hwaro build --memory-limit`: zero and absurd values rejected with clear messages (#572)
- Multilingual search: scoped to the current language via per-entry `lang` (#575)
- `.html` aliases write to the exact path; pretty aliases still get `index.html` (#576)
- Default themes emit JSON-LD — `{{ jsonld }}` wired into simple/blog/docs/book `<head>` (#577)
- AMP: disallowed external stylesheets stripped; allowlisted font stylesheets kept (#578)
- Multilingual: default-language taxonomy pages no longer duplicated under `/<default_language>/` (#579)
- `blog` scaffold: posts render with `post.html` instead of falling back to `page.html` (#580)
- Alert shortcode: body renders as Markdown (#581)
- Homepage JSON-LD: emits `WebSite` instead of an empty-headline `Article` (#582)
- `docs`/`book` themes render the in-page TOC when `toc = true`; `book` archetype enables it by default (#584)
- `[highlight] use_cdn = false` warns when self-hosted highlight.js assets are missing (#585)
- `hwaro build --cache`: fully-cached rebuild no longer prints the false "No content found" hint (#586)
- AMP: self-closing markdown images no longer emit an invalid `<amp-img … / layout="fill">` (#588)
- `base_url` trailing slash no longer produces `//` in links/canonical/OG URLs (#589)
- `hwaro new`: double quotes in title/date escaped in generated front matter (#590)
- Blog series navigation orders prev/next by `series_weight` (#591)
- Multilingual: root taxonomy term pages list only the default language's posts (#592)
- Pagination SEO: headers render `{{ pagination_seo_links }}` (`rel="prev"`/`"next"`) (#594)
- Scaffold nav: dynamic-section-loop example wrapped in `{% raw %}` and scoped to the current language (#595)
- Permalinks: empty `[permalinks]` target maps to the site root instead of `//contact/` (#596)
- Multilingual/tooling: per-language `taxonomies` honored; `check-links` skips code spans; Hugo-shortcode warning shows both conversions (#600)
- `base_url` subpath deploys: alias redirects and PWA manifest/service worker include the path prefix via `Config#base_path` (#603)
- SEO/tooling: `Page#plain_summary` keeps raw Markdown out of descriptions; JSON-LD escapes `<>&`; `check-links` resolves `@/` links (#606)
- `hwaro init`/`new`: typo hint suggests the closest key (`tag`→`tags`); `sanitize_url_segment` drops dangling hyphen before extensions (#607)

### Performance
- Markdown: combined regex passes for common extension sets
- Shortcodes: fence + inline-code aware pre-filter
- OG / profiling: base-layer caching, batched yielding, full timing in `--profile`
- Streaming: reduced cache invalidation / GC frequency under `--stream`/`--memory-limit`

## v0.14.2

### Fixed
- Security: the GitHub Action no longer leaks the workflow token into `hwaro build`; the credential is scoped to a deploy-only `DEPLOY_TOKEN` (gh#550)
- Security: `redirect_to` pages can no longer escape `output_dir` via a traversing front-matter `path` (gh#549)
- Multi-threaded builds: `FileSafe.mkdir_p` no longer raises `File exists` when workers race on shared parent directories

### Changed
- `hwaro build --minify` now actually shrinks HTML (~-12%): per-tag protected passes, block-vs-inline whitespace collapse, quote-aware tag-opening shrink (gh#411)

### Performance
- OG image generation: shared base layer `memcpy`'d per page with a parallel render pass; bit-identical output, ~4.5–6.6x faster on a 200-page site

## v0.14.1

### Fixed
- Multilingual: `section.pages`, `series_pages`, `related_posts`, and the global pages array now expose `translations` per item (gh#540)
- `page.lower`/`page.higher` now populated for page bundles (gh#539)

## v0.14.0

### Behavior changes
- `hwaro new <path>.md` honors the typed path instead of rerouting bare filenames to `content/drafts/`
- `hwaro new` refuses to run outside a Hwaro project (`HWARO_E_CONFIG`)
- `hwaro build --drafts` no longer includes drafts in `sitemap.xml`

### Fixed
- `tool list drafts`: `TitlePath` header no longer glued together for short titles
- `tool convert`: TOML↔YAML round-trip preserves (and doesn't invent) the delimiter/body blank line
- `tool export jekyll`: dated content lands flat in `_posts/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`; non-dated pages stay at the root
- `Logger.progress` emits a single completion line instead of `\r` animation when stdout isn't a TTY
- `doctor`: stop reporting niche optional sections as missing; `bare` sites are doctor-clean
- `book` scaffold: `[related]` shipped commented out (no taxonomies to reference)
- All scaffolds populate `description` so freshly-init'd sites pass `tool validate`

### Changed
- Build summary: `Generated N pages` → `Generated N content pages`
- `hwaro build` hints when a build produces zero content pages
- `hwaro init` prints a `Tip: update base_url` line; "Added N optional config section(s)" demoted to debug
- `--env <name>`: missing-`config.<name>.toml` warning names the env and file and explains recovery
- `hwaro build` warns once per page on Hugo-style `{{< … >}}` shortcode syntax
- `[markdown] math`/`mermaid` now render in-browser — headers pull KaTeX/MathJax and Mermaid.js from a CDN; opt out via `{{ math_tags }}`/`{{ mermaid_tags }}`
- Importers strip the body's leading `# Title` when it matches the front-matter title (gh#525)
- `tool import obsidian` resolves `[[Wiki-Link]]`, `|alias`, and `#anchor` to absolute URLs

### Performance
- Multi-threaded build on by default (`-Dpreview_mt`): ~30% faster on a 1000-page site (`CRYSTAL_WORKERS=8`); tune via `CRYSTAL_WORKERS`
- New `Utils::FileSafe.mkdir_p` survives the check-then-create race under MT
- Shortcode template cache and missing-shortcode warning Set are mutex-protected
- `MarkdownConfig#math_tags`/`#mermaid_tags` and header partials skip output when the flag is off
- `TextUtils.escape_xml` short-circuits when no XML-special bytes are present
- `related_posts` lookup skips the cache mutex when the page has no related posts

- `tool` errors: usage classification (#469), `tool export --help` lists supported targets (#468)
- Import: summarize unconverted constructs (#455), WordPress `<pubDate>` and table conversion (#454), preserve categories as taxonomy (#453), Obsidian YAML array flattening (#452), error classification with `--force` (#451)
- Doctor: narrow rescue and atomic write in `--fix` (#442); exit non-zero on errors (#440)
- Deploy: reject unknown placeholders in command templates (#435); classify failures under `HwaroError` (#433)
- Serve: ignore editor backup/swap files (#417); reorder banners behind successful bind (#416)
- Validate `base_url` scheme and host at load/CLI time (#413)
- Restore trailing-whitespace strip in minifier and align help text (#410)
