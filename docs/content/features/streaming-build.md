Streaming build reduces memory usage for large sites by processing pages in batches during the Render phase. Instead of holding all rendered HTML in memory at once, each batch is rendered, written to disk, and then released before the next batch begins.

```bash
hwaro build --stream
```

## When to Use

For most sites, the default build mode works well. Streaming build is useful when:

- Your site has thousands of pages
- The build process consumes too much memory
- You're building in a memory-constrained environment (CI, containers, small VMs)

## Usage

### `--stream` flag

Enable streaming with a default batch size of 500 pages:

```bash
hwaro build --stream
```

### `--memory-limit` flag

Set a memory limit and let Hwaro calculate the optimal batch size automatically:

```bash
hwaro build --memory-limit 512M
hwaro build --memory-limit 2G
```

Accepts `G` (gigabytes), `M` (megabytes), and `K` (kilobytes) suffixes. The batch size is calculated using a heuristic of ~50KB per page.

### Environment variable

Set `HWARO_MEMORYLIMIT` as a fallback when the CLI flag is not provided:

```bash
export HWARO_MEMORYLIMIT=1G
hwaro build
```

The CLI `--memory-limit` flag always overrides the environment variable.

### Combined flags

You can combine `--stream` with `--memory-limit`. When `--memory-limit` is provided, it determines the batch size regardless of `--stream`:

```bash
hwaro build --stream --memory-limit 512M
```

## Flag Interaction

| `--stream` | `--memory-limit` | `HWARO_MEMORYLIMIT` | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | - | Normal build |
| yes | - | - | Streaming, batch=500 |
| - | 2G | - | Streaming, batch≈20000 |
| - | - | 1G | Streaming, batch≈10000 |
| yes | 512M | - | Streaming, batch≈5000 |
| - | 2G | 1G | CLI wins (2G) |

## How It Works

1. During the Render phase, pages are split into batches
2. Each batch is rendered using the same parallel/sequential logic as a normal build
3. After each batch is written to disk, `page.content` is cleared to free memory
4. The garbage collector is invoked to reclaim the released memory
5. After the Generate phase (feeds, sitemap, search index), `page.raw_content` is also cleared

The Generate phase (feeds, search, sitemap, llms.txt) still works correctly because these generators already fall back to re-rendering from `raw_content` when `page.content` is empty.

## Output

The build output is **identical** whether streaming is enabled or not. Streaming only affects memory usage during the build process.

Use `--verbose` to see batch progress:

```bash
hwaro build --stream --verbose
```

```
Building site...
  Streaming mode enabled (batch size: 500)
  ...
  Streaming batch 1 (500 pages)
  Streaming batch 2 (500 pages)
  Streaming batch 3 (234 pages)
  ...
```
