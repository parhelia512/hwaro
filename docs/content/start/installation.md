## Pre-built Binary

Pre-built binaries for macOS and Linux are available on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hahwul/hwaro/releases) page.

1. Download the binary for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/hahwul/hwaro/releases/latest).
2. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH.

```bash
# Example for Linux (amd64)
chmod +x hwaro-v*-linux-x86_64
sudo mv hwaro-v*-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/hwaro
```

## From Source

### Prerequisites

- [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/install/) 1.19+
- Git

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hahwul/hwaro
cd hwaro
shards install
shards build --release --no-debug
```

The binary is created at `./bin/hwaro`.

> Requires Crystal **1.21 or newer**. Parallel page rendering is enabled in
> `src/main.cr`, which resizes Crystal's default execution context — no build
> flag needed. Set `CRYSTAL_WORKERS=N` to override the worker count (it
> defaults to the CPU count). Do not pass the old `-Dpreview_mt` flag:
> Crystal 1.21 deprecated it and its scheduler can hang at process exit.

### Add to PATH (Optional)

```bash
# Copy to a directory in your PATH
sudo cp ./bin/hwaro /usr/local/bin/

# Or add the bin directory to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"
```

## Verify Installation

```bash
hwaro --version
```
