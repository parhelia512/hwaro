Hwaro provides commands for creating, building, and serving your site.

## Global flags

These flags work with every top-level command and control how the CLI
writes to the terminal. They are especially useful for scripts, CI logs,
and AI agents that want clean output.

| Flag / Env var | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `-q`, `--quiet` | Suppress informational output and the startup banner. Warnings and errors still appear on stderr. |
| `NO_COLOR` (env) | When set to any non-empty value, suppresses ANSI color codes from every command's output. Follows the [no-color.org](https://no-color.org) cross-tool convention. |

Colors are also disabled automatically when stdout is not a TTY (for
example when piping to `cat`, redirecting to a file, or running inside
most CI systems). Set `NO_COLOR=1` to force-disable color everywhere;
no extra flag is needed.

```bash
# Silent build for scripts and CI — only warnings/errors surface.
hwaro build --quiet

# Plain ASCII (no ANSI escapes) even when stdout is a TTY.
NO_COLOR=1 hwaro doctor
```

### Error taxonomy

Classified failure paths emit a stable error code plus a matching
process exit code so scripts, CI, and agents can branch reliably
without parsing human messages.

In text mode the error line is prefixed with the code:

```
Error [HWARO_E_USAGE]: missing <path> argument
```

Under `--json` the classified error is emitted as a structured payload
on stdout instead. (`--quiet` only silences info output — errors keep
the human `Error [CODE]: …` form on stderr, so pair it with `--json`
when you want machine-readable failures.)

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "HWARO_E_USAGE",
    "category": "usage",
    "message": "missing <path> argument",
    "hint": "Usage: hwaro new <path> [options] — run 'hwaro new --help' for details."
  }
}
```

Unclassified failures keep the legacy `Error: <message>` format and
exit code `1`, so this is a strictly additive contract.

| Code | Category | Exit | Description |
|------|----------|------|-------------|
| `HWARO_E_USAGE` | usage | 2 | Bad/missing flag, missing required argument, unknown command |
| `HWARO_E_CONFIG` | config | 3 | `config.toml` missing, unparseable, or invalid |
| `HWARO_E_TEMPLATE` | template | 4 | Crinja template render error |
| `HWARO_E_CONTENT` | content | 5 | Content file parse error, invalid frontmatter |
| `HWARO_E_IO` | io | 6 | Filesystem access error (missing dir, permission denied) |
| `HWARO_E_NETWORK` | network | 7 | Deploy upload, remote scaffold fetch failure |
| `HWARO_E_INTERNAL` | internal | 70 | Unrecoverable bug or unexpected state |
| *(unclassified)* | — | 1 | Legacy/generic failure path |
| *(success)* | — | 0 | Command completed normally |

## Commands

### init

Create a new site:

```bash
hwaro init                    # initialize immediately with defaults
hwaro init my-site            # initialize in my-site/
hwaro init --wizard           # interactive wizard (TTY): scaffold, title
hwaro init my-site --wizard   # wizard; directory prompt skipped (path taken from arg)
hwaro init my-site --scaffold blog
hwaro init my-site --scaffold docs
hwaro init my-site --scaffold book
```

**Interactive mode:**

Pass `--wizard` in an interactive terminal to open a guided flow: it asks for
the directory, a scaffold, and the site title, then shows a
summary and asks to confirm before writing anything. When a path argument is
given (`hwaro init my-site --wizard`), the wizard skips the directory prompt
and uses that path directly.

Without `--wizard`, `hwaro init` initializes immediately with defaults — the
same behaviour scripts and CI already relied on.

Every scaffold follows the reader's OS color scheme automatically (the shared
token system uses CSS `light-dark()` pairs), and the styled scaffolds ship a
header theme switcher that cycles auto → light → dark and remembers the choice
in `localStorage`. To force one scheme permanently instead, add
`:root { color-scheme: dark; }` (or `light`) at the end of `css/style.css`.

You can also use a remote scaffold from a GitHub repository:

```bash
# GitHub shorthand
hwaro init my-site --scaffold github:user/repo
hwaro init my-site --scaffold github:user/repo/docs

# Full URL
hwaro init my-site --scaffold https://github.com/user/repo
hwaro init my-site --scaffold https://github.com/user/repo/tree/main/docs
```

Remote scaffolds fetch `config.toml`, `templates/`, `static/`, and content structure from the repository. Content files keep only front matter (metadata) so you can see the expected page structure without the original body text. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to avoid API rate limits.

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| --scaffold TYPE | Built-in (`simple`, `bare`, `blog`, `docs`, `book`) or remote source (`github:user/repo[/path]`, URL) |
| --wizard | Run the interactive wizard (TTY only) |
| --agents MODE | AGENTS.md content mode: `remote` (lightweight, default) or `local` (full embedded reference) |
| -f, --force | Force creation even if directory is not empty |
| --skip-agents-md | Skip creating AGENTS.md file |
| --skip-sample-content | Skip creating sample content files |
| --skip-taxonomies | Skip taxonomies configuration and templates |
| --include-multilingual LANGS | Enable multilingual support (e.g., `en,ko,ja`) |
| --minimal-config | Generate minimal `config.toml` without comments or optional sections |
| --list-scaffolds | List available built-in scaffolds and exit |
| --json | Emit machine-readable JSON output (with --list-scaffolds) |

### new

Create a new content file:

```bash
hwaro new                                     # interactive wizard (TTY): prompts for everything
hwaro new content/about.md
hwaro new content/blog/my-post.md
hwaro new posts/my-post.md -a posts
hwaro new my-post.md --section blog --draft --tags "go,web" --date 2026-03-22
```

Creates a Markdown file with front matter template. Supports **archetypes** for customizable templates.

**Interactive mode:**

Running `hwaro new` without a `<path>` in an interactive terminal opens a guided wizard.
It prompts for the title, description, a **recommended path** (derived from the title and
section), tags, date, draft flag, and archetype, then shows a summary and asks to confirm
before writing. Any flags you already passed pre-fill the matching prompt, so
`hwaro new -t "My Post"` only asks for the rest. Press `Ctrl-D` or answer `n` at the final
prompt to cancel without creating anything.

The wizard never runs in non-interactive contexts — pipes, CI, agents, `--json`, or
`--quiet` — which instead print the classified `HWARO_E_USAGE` error, so scripted callers
stay predictable. Pass a `<path>` (and any flags) to skip the prompts entirely.

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -t, --title TITLE | Content title |
| --date DATE | Content date (default: now, e.g. `2026-03-22`) |
| --draft | Mark as draft |
| --tags TAGS | Comma-separated tags |
| -s, --section NAME | Section directory (e.g. `blog`, `docs`) |
| -a, --archetype NAME | Archetype to use |
| --bundle | Create a leaf-bundle directory (`foo/index.md`) instead of a single file |
| --no-bundle | Force a single file (`foo.md`); overrides `[content.new].bundle = true` |
| --list-archetypes | List archetypes in the current project and exit |
| --json | Emit machine-readable JSON output (archetypes listing and classified errors) |

**Archetypes:**

Archetypes are template files in `archetypes/` directory that define default front matter for new content:

- `archetypes/default.md` - Default template for all content
- `archetypes/posts.md` - Used for `hwaro new posts/...`
- `archetypes/tools/develop.md` - Used for `hwaro new tools/develop/...`

Archetype files support placeholders: `{{ title }}`, `{{ date }}`, `{{ draft }}`, `{{ tags }}`, `{{ description }}`

Example archetype (`archetypes/posts.md`):
```
---
title: "{{ title }}"
date: {{ date }}
draft: false
tags: []
---

# {{ title }}
```

Archetype matching priority:
1. Explicit `-a` flag (e.g., `-a posts` uses `archetypes/posts.md`)
2. Path-based matching (e.g., `posts/hello.md` checks `archetypes/posts.md`)
3. Nested paths try parent archetypes (e.g., `tools/dev/x.md` tries `tools/dev.md`, then `tools.md`)
4. Falls back to `archetypes/default.md`
5. Uses built-in template if no archetype found

### build

Build the site to `public/`:

```bash
hwaro build
hwaro build --drafts
hwaro build --minify
hwaro build -i /path/to/my-site
hwaro build -i /path/to/my-site -o ./dist
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -i, --input DIR | Project directory to build (default: current directory) |
| -o, --output DIR | Output directory (default: public) |
| --base-url URL | Temporarily override `base_url` from `config.toml` |
| -e, --env ENV | Environment name (loads `config.<env>.toml` override) |
| -d, --drafts | Include draft content |
| --include-expired | Include expired content |
| --include-future | Include future-dated content |
| --minify | Minify output files (see below) |
| --no-parallel | Disable parallel processing |
| --jobs N | Concurrent render workers. Default: auto, derived from the site listing fan-out (see below) |
| --cache | Enable incremental build caching (see below) |
| --full | Force a complete rebuild, clearing the cache |
| --skip-highlighting | Disable syntax highlighting |
| --skip-og-image | Skip auto OG image generation |
| --skip-image-processing | Skip image resizing and LQIP generation |
| --skip-cache-busting | Disable cache busting query parameters on CSS/JS resources |
| --stream | Enable streaming build to reduce memory usage |
| --memory-limit SIZE | Memory limit for streaming build (e.g. `2G`, `512M`) |
| -v, --verbose | Show detailed output |
| --profile | Print phase-by-phase and per-template build timing |
| --debug | Print debug information after build |

**About `--stream` / `--memory-limit` (Streaming Build):**

For sites with thousands of pages, loading all rendered HTML into memory at once can cause high memory usage. Streaming build processes pages in batches during the Render phase, releasing rendered HTML after each batch is written to disk.

- `--stream` enables streaming with a default batch size of 500 pages.
- `--memory-limit SIZE` enables streaming and calculates the batch size automatically based on the given limit (heuristic: ~50KB per page). Accepts `G`, `M`, `K` suffixes (e.g. `2G`, `512M`, `256K`).
- You can also set the `HWARO_MEMORYLIMIT` environment variable as a fallback. The CLI flag overrides the env var.

| `--stream` | `--memory-limit` | `HWARO_MEMORYLIMIT` | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| - | - | - | Normal build |
| yes | - | - | Streaming, batch=500 |
| - | 2G | - | Streaming, batch≈20000 |
| - | - | 1G | Streaming, batch≈10000 |
| yes | 512M | - | Streaming, batch≈5000 |
| - | 2G | 1G | CLI wins (2G) |

The build output is identical — streaming only affects memory usage during the build.

**About `--minify`:**

The minify flag shrinks generated files while keeping them visually identical to the un-minified output:

- **HTML**: Removes comments (preserves conditional comments, SSI directives, `<!-- more -->`), strips trailing whitespace, collapses intra-tag whitespace (runs between attributes shrink to one space, quoted attribute values stay untouched), and collapses inter-tag whitespace by neighbour classification. If either neighbour is a block-level element the whitespace is stripped entirely (browsers collapse whitespace at the start, end, or between block siblings anyway); only when *both* neighbours are inline is a single space kept so the visible gap of `<a>x</a> <a>y</a>` is preserved.
- **JSON**: Removes whitespace and newlines for compact output.
- **XML**: Removes whitespace between tags for smaller file sizes.

Whitespace-sensitive elements — `<pre>`, `<code>`, `<textarea>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, `<svg>`, `<math>`, `<noscript>` — are extracted before any whitespace pass and restored verbatim, so their contents are never touched.

For more aggressive output shrinking (attribute quoting, entity collapsing, etc.) post-process `public/` with a dedicated tool such as `html-minifier-terser` or `minify-html`.

**About `--cache` (Incremental Build):**

When enabled, Hwaro tracks file modification times and content checksums in a `.hwaro_cache.json` file at the project root. On subsequent builds, only files that have changed since the last build are re-rendered. The cache also tracks template and config checksums — if templates or `config.toml` change, all entries are automatically invalidated and every page is rebuilt.

Use `--full` together with `--cache` to force a clean rebuild while still saving the cache for the next run:

```bash
hwaro build --cache --full
```

See [Incremental Build](/features/incremental-build/) for details.

**About `--jobs` (render concurrency):**

By default Hwaro picks the number of concurrent render workers from your site's **listing fan-out** — how many page objects a single page render materializes from a site-wide collection. `--jobs N` overrides that. It never changes the generated output, only how many pages render at once.

Fan-out is what caps useful parallelism, not the core count. Every `{% for p in site.pages %}` or `{% for p in section.pages %}` iteration allocates one object per item, and past a small worker count the garbage collector's global allocation lock serializes that work while extra workers add only contention. So the automatic count is:

| Items materialized per page render | Workers |
|---|---|
| 500 or more (e.g. a `page` template listing every page on a large site) | 1 |
| 100–499 | 2 |
| Under 100 (most sites) | up to 4 |

A homepage that lists every page does not count against this — the estimate is the mean across rendered pages, so one expensive listing page among thousands of cheap ones leaves the site on the fast path.

```bash
hwaro build --jobs 4   # override the automatic count
```

Leave it unset unless you are benchmarking; the automatic count is within a few percent of the best fixed value on every corpus we measure. `--jobs` has no effect together with `--no-parallel`.

**About `-i, --input`:**

When specified, Hwaro changes its working directory to the given path before building. This lets you build a site located in another directory without `cd`-ing into it first.

- All site sources (`config.toml`, `content/`, `templates/`, `static/`) are read from the input directory.
- **Without `-o`:** The default output directory `public/` is created inside the input directory (i.e., the site's own `public/` folder). This is the natural behavior — `hwaro build -i ../my-site` produces `../my-site/public/`.
- **With `-o`:** The output path is resolved relative to **your current directory** (not the input directory), so `hwaro build -i ../my-site -o ./dist` writes output to `./dist` in your shell's CWD.
- If `-i` is omitted, behavior is unchanged — the current directory is used.

### serve

Start a development server with live reload (enabled by default):

```bash
hwaro serve
hwaro serve --port 8080
hwaro serve --open
hwaro serve --access-log
hwaro serve --no-live-reload
hwaro serve -i /path/to/my-site
hwaro serve -i /path/to/my-site -p 8080
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -i, --input DIR | Project directory to serve (default: current directory) |
| -b, --bind HOST | Bind address (default: 127.0.0.1). IPv6 literals are supported and appear bracketed in every generated URL (`-b ::1` → `http://[::1]:3000`) |
| -p, --port PORT | Port number (default: 3000) |
| --base-url URL | Temporarily override `base_url` from `config.toml`. If the URL carries a path, the dev server mounts the site under that prefix (see below) |
| -e, --env ENV | Environment name (loads `config.<env>.toml` override) |
| --minify | Serve minified output |
| --jobs N | Concurrent render workers. Default: auto, derived from the site listing fan-out |
| --open | Open browser after starting |
| -d, --drafts | Include draft content |
| --include-expired | Include expired content |
| --include-future | Include future-dated content |
| -v, --verbose | Show detailed output |
| --debug | Print debug information after each rebuild |
| --access-log | Show HTTP access log (e.g. GET requests) |
| --no-error-overlay | Disable in-browser error overlay (default: enabled) |
| --live-reload | Enable browser live reload on file changes (default: enabled; kept for backwards compatibility) |
| --no-live-reload | Disable browser live reload on file changes |
| --header "NAME: VALUE" | Add custom response header (repeatable). Merged with `[serve.headers]` from `config.toml` (CLI wins). Only affects `hwaro serve`. |
| --cache | Enable build caching (skip unchanged files) |
| --stream | Enable streaming build to reduce memory usage |
| --memory-limit SIZE | Memory limit for streaming build (e.g. `2G`, `512M`) |
| --fast-start | Render homepage + latest N pages first, then background-render the rest |
| --fast-start-count N | Number of recent pages to render up front with `--fast-start` (default: 20) |
| --skip-cache-busting | Disable cache busting query parameters on CSS/JS resources |
| --skip-og-image | Skip auto OG image generation |
| --skip-image-processing | Skip image resizing and LQIP generation |
| --profile | Print phase-by-phase and per-template build timing |

> **Fast dev server on large sites:** Set `[og.auto_image] lazy_generate = true` in `config.toml` to skip bulk OG generation during `hwaro serve`. Images are created on first request instead. See the [Performance in Development section](/features/og-images/#performance-in-development) for the full explanation and recommended workflow with `--fast-start`.

The server watches for file changes and rebuilds automatically. It uses **smart rebuild strategies** based on what changed:

| Change Type | Strategy | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `config.toml` | Full rebuild | Rebuilds entire site |
| `content/` only | Incremental | Rebuilds only affected content pages |
| `templates/` only | Template re-render | Re-renders all pages with existing content |
| `static/` only | Static copy | Copies only changed static files |
| Mixed / new / deleted files | Full rebuild | Rebuilds entire site |

**About live reload:**

Live reload is **enabled by default**. The server injects a small WebSocket client script into every HTML response, and after each successful rebuild, connected browsers automatically refresh the page — no manual reload needed. The client uses exponential backoff (1s–30s) for reconnection, so restarting the server won't break the connection permanently.

Pass `--no-live-reload` to disable this behaviour (useful for testing production-like delivery locally). The `--live-reload` flag is kept as a no-op alias for backwards compatibility with existing invocations.

When `-i` is specified, the server operates as if you had `cd`-ed into the given directory — watching and serving from that project root.

**Subpath preview (`--base-url` with a path):**

```bash
hwaro serve --base-url http://localhost:3000/myblog/
```

The site is built with `/myblog/`-prefixed links and served under that same prefix, so a project-page deployment (GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages) can be previewed exactly as it will be published — instead of a homepage whose every link 404s locally.

- `/` redirects to `/myblog/`.
- Unprefixed requests still resolve, so hand-typed asset paths keep working.
- Live reload, the file watcher, and the WebSocket endpoint all work under the prefix.

**Request handling:**

- The server answers `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS`. Any other method returns `405 Method Not Allowed` with an `Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS` header, rather than the 404 page.
- Malformed request paths (for example a percent-encoded NUL byte) return `400 Bad Request`.
- `HEAD` returns exactly the same headers as the matching `GET` — including the `Content-Length` of the live-reload-injected HTML — with no body.
- Text responses (`.txt`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.js`, `.css`, `.svg`, …) always carry `; charset=utf-8`, regardless of file size.
- Directory redirects emit a percent-encoded `Location` (`/my%20page/`, `/%ED%95%9C%EA%B8%80/`). Paths containing a backslash or an encoded separator (`%2F`, `%5C`) are not served, matching static-host behaviour.

**Custom response headers (`--header` / `[serve.headers]`):**

Use this to reproduce headers that your production reverse-proxy, CDN, or static hosting sets (security headers, `Cache-Control`, custom CORS, etc.) so you can test locally before deploying the static output.

```toml
[serve.headers]
X-Frame-Options = "SAMEORIGIN"
X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
# Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"
```

```bash
hwaro serve --header "X-Custom: foo" --header "Cache-Control: no-store"
```

- CLI `--header` values win over the same key in `config.toml`.
- Headers are injected on **every** dev-server response (HTML, assets, 404s, redirects, live-reload injected pages, CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) responses).
- This feature only affects `hwaro serve`. The files written to `public/` are untouched.

### deploy

Deploy the generated site to configured targets.

```bash
hwaro deploy [target ...]
hwaro deploy --dry-run
```

**Options:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| -s, --source DIR | Source directory to deploy (default: deployment.source_dir or public) |
| --dry-run | Show planned changes without writing |
| --confirm | Ask for confirmation before deploying |
| --force | Force upload/copy (ignore file comparisons) |
| --max-deletes N | Maximum number of deletes (default: deployment.maxDeletes or 256, -1 disables) |
| --list-targets | List configured deployment targets and exit |
| --json | Emit machine-readable JSON output (with --list-targets) |

### doctor

Diagnose config, template, and structure issues (top-level shortcut):

```bash
hwaro doctor               # Diagnose config, template, and structure issues
hwaro doctor --fix         # Normalize config values (base_url trailing slash, sitemap priority…)
hwaro doctor --approve     # Add recommended config sections to config.toml
hwaro doctor --full        # Both (equivalent to --fix --approve)
```

**Exit codes.** `doctor` returns a classified exit code based on the most
severe issue reported, so CI pipelines can gate on it directly:

| Outcome | Exit |
|---|---|
| No issues, warnings only, or info-level findings | `0` |
| Config errors (missing/broken `config.toml`) | `3` (`HWARO_E_CONFIG`) |
| Template errors (missing required file, unclosed tags) | `4` (`HWARO_E_TEMPLATE`) |
| Content errors (malformed front matter, when the check lands) | `5` (`HWARO_E_CONTENT`) |
| Other error-level issues | `1` |

Warnings (empty `base_url`, trailing slash, duplicate taxonomy names, etc.)
are advisory and never change the exit code.

For content validation, use `hwaro tool validate`. See [doctor](/start/tools/doctor/) for details.
